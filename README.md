# vanishing-gradients
- Practical implementation of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks
- First we trained a less dense NN but no vanishing gradient problem and no good accuracy 
- then we trained a dense NN , accuracy increased but vanishing gradient problem started
- We changed the actib=vation function to ReLU and problem solved.
